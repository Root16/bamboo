# Powerapps-WRE README

Powerapps-WRE is a VSCode extension enabling Dynamics 365 developes to manage their web resources.

## Features

- Export, edit, then import your web resources directly from vscode. 
- Simple and secure authentication to Dynamics 

## Requirements

- This extension comes with a dependency on the [Power Platform Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microsoft-IsvExpTools.powerplatform-vscode) and will prompt the user to install the dependency upon login.

## Known Issues

- Currently there is no way to selectively update web resources. The import/export functionality does a complete update of the entire solution. This may cause issues if other developes are working on the same solution.

## Release Notes
